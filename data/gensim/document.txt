"Democracy, secularism and rights of people are threatened under BJP government at the Centre. We will work with all opposition parties; 'BJP Quit India in 2019' will be our slogan," Mamata said at a public meeting in West Midnapore on Wednesday.
The chief minister alleged that the BJP was practicing divisive politics to destroy the secular fabric of the country.
