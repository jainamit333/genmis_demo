While the nation is commemorating the 75th anniversary of Quit India Movement, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has launched the "BJP Quit India Movement" to oust the saffron party from the country.
"Democracy, secularism and rights of people are threatened under BJP government at the Centre. We will work with all opposition parties; 'BJP Quit India in 2019' will be our slogan," Mamata said at a public meeting in West Midnapore on Wednesday.
